> *Sokoban (倉庫番 sōko-ban, "warehouse keeper")* is a type of puzzle video game, in which the player pushes crates or boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations.

> The game is played on a board of squares, where each square is a floor or a wall. Some floor squares contain boxes, and some floor squares are marked as storage locations. The player is confined to the board, and may move horizontally or vertically onto empty squares (never through walls or boxes). The player can also move into a box, which pushes it into the square beyond. Boxes may not be pushed into other boxes or walls, and they cannot be pulled. The number of boxes is equal to the number of storage locations. The puzzle is solved when all boxes are at storage locations.

<p> The main purpose of this project creation was to pass the fundamentals of programming in C++ academic course at University.
 Nevertheless, developing the Sokoban Game with console user interface using only standard libraries allowed me to advance my understanding of the mere logic behind the basic components of programming like control flow structures, loops, functions, arrays etc. Connecting everything as easy as possible but still while working as intended. </p>
